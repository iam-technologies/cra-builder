# CRA-builder
Tool to create CreateReactApp boilerplate projects

The main idea behind this project is to avoid mantaining libraries and packages versions included into a boilerplate. Instead, this tool executes the initial commands that are needed to init a CreateReactApp project.

## Usage
```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iam-technologies/cra-builder/master/cra-boilerplate.sh) <app-name>
```
